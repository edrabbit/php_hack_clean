php_hack_clean

A quick python script to help track down php insert hacks and clean them up. 
Useful for Dreamhost, which seems to get this a lot.

Simple to use, just copy and paste the nasty code into the script and run.
I highly recommend backing up your files first!
Use at your own risk. Read the (very simple) code and understand what it's
doing before you run it.

Infected files will be backed up into a _BACKUP directory.
